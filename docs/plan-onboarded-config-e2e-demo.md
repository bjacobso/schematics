# Plan: Unified end-to-end demo for `onboarded-config`

This is the runbook _and_ the build plan for one continuous story:

```text
connect to an Onboarded account
  -> pull a live snapshot into a workspace
  -> commit it (git is now the store)
  -> prove git holds the data
  -> agent edits the config
  -> commit the agent turn (with provenance)
  -> validate + re-prove
  -> fork the account into a draft branch ("copy of mina")
  -> agent works the draft
  -> human reviews a diff
  -> merge back into main  ==  re-pull and reconcile  (same fixed point)
```

The goal is to turn the existing infra — git-backed `ArtifactStore`
([plan-git-artifacts.md](./plan-git-artifacts.md)), the
`@schematics/onboarded-config` deploy engine
([plan-onboarded-config.md](./plan-onboarded-config.md)), and the agent toolkit
— into a single demo you can run start-to-finish and point at.

It complements, and does not replace:

- [architecture-deployment-modes.md](./architecture-deployment-modes.md) — the
  detailed topology (mermaid) of how local / playground / Cloudflare modes wire
  services and data; read it alongside this plan.
- [git-artifacts-demo.md](./git-artifacts-demo.md) — the local vs Cloudflare
  git store runbook (the storage substrate this demo sits on).
- [plan-account-config-workspace.md](./plan-account-config-workspace.md) — the
  single-account workspace shape (`account.yaml`, `forms/`, `policies/`, …).
- [plan-config-deploy-ui.md](./plan-config-deploy-ui.md) — the pull/plan/apply
  UI loop this demo drives.

## The thesis

`@schematics/onboarded-config` already models an account as a folder of YAML
(`AccountWorkspaceValue` in `workspace.ts`), and `@schematics/alchemy` already
does **pull → plan → apply** against the Onboarded API (live or mock). Separately,
`git-artifacts` already gives us a commit-on-change store with provenance
trailers. **Nobody has stitched the two together end to end.** When we do, git
stops being a side feature and becomes the store of record for a customer's
configuration — every state in the loop above is a commit, every agent edit is
attributable, and "make a draft and merge it back" becomes a first-class
operation instead of a copy-paste.

## What exists vs. what we build

Grounded in the current tree (file references are starting points, not
contracts):

| Capability                                             | Status                   | Where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Three architectural seams

The remaining gaps still reduce to three seams. Build or extend them in this
order; each is independently demoable.

### Seam A — Who commits the files? (close the store loop)

Today the **local IDE/RPC edit** path commits (isomorphic-git over `node:fs`),
and the standalone deploy CLI closes its import loop with
`onboarded-deploy pull --commit`. The **hosted** path provisions a repo, lets the
browser push commits through the worker git proxy, and mirrors committed deploy
snapshots back into Durable Object storage. Two sub-cases:

- **Local (small build):** `onboarded-deploy pull --commit` writes the snapshot
  and creates an intentional git import commit via `LocalGitCommitter`, including
  the persisted `config.lock.json`.
- **Hosted (build):** the worker can't run git (pulls `isomorphic-git`/`crc-32`
  into the bundle, which broke the deploy). The clean seam is:
  - **Browser** runs `isomorphic-git` over the in-memory FS (`mem-fs.ts`):
    clone → stage current files → commit (with `Actor`/`Turn-Id` trailers) →
    push. The hosted e2e now proves both user edits and deploy pull/apply commits
    through this path.
  - **Worker** becomes a thin authenticating git **CORS-proxy**: forwards
    smart-HTTP bytes to the Artifacts remote and injects the scoped token
    server-side. No git logic in the worker; the token never reaches the
    browser. This proxy route is now implemented at
    `/v1/workspaces/:id/git/*`. (Browsers can't push to git hosts directly and
    isomorphic-git needs a CORS proxy anyway, so this falls out naturally.)

**Deliverable:** a `commit-on-pull` and `commit-on-change` path that is
identical in shape locally and hosted, so the rest of the demo is
backend-agnostic.

### Seam B — Make git visible (history RPC + panel)

`features.history` is in the protocol, and the local git-backed path now has a
history RPC and UI. The remaining work is to make the capability explicit enough
for non-git and hosted stores:

1. **`GetHistory` RPC** in `SchematicsArtifactProjectRpcGroup`
   (`protocol/src/artifact-project.ts`) returns the commit list (`oid`,
   `message`, parsed `Actor`/`Turn-Id`/`Tool-Call-Id` trailers, author,
   timestamp) for local git workspaces.
2. **Server handler** in `server/src/artifact-project-rpc.ts` delegates to the
   local project client's git history adapter. Hosted DO currently returns
   unsupported until it has a git-backed commit path.
3. **History panel** in the React surface renders a version timeline; click a
   revision to inspect it.
4. **Diff view** shows schema-aware field diffs for parseable JSON/YAML via
   `alchemy/src/diff.ts`, while keeping raw file diffs for lockfiles and other
   non-config files.

This is on for the **local CLI first** — it commits IDE/RPC edits and sets
`history: true` when the served directory is inside a git repo — so you get a
working timeline against a local git repo with zero cloud dependency. The
import/pull commit is the extra local seam from Seam A.

### Seam C — Fork & merge (the "copy of mina" story)

This is the headline. Model it on top of git branches, _not_ a new abstraction:

- **`fork(name)`** → create a branch (`refs/heads/draft/<name>`) from the
  current HEAD and return a `GitArtifactStore` bound to it (the `branch` option
  already exists per-store; fork is "create branch + open store on it"). The
  local CLI slice now exposes this as `onboarded-deploy fork --branch <name>`.
- **Agent works the draft store** — same toolkit, commits land on the branch.
  The local filesystem committer now follows the checked-out branch at commit
  and history-read time unless a branch is explicitly pinned.
- **`diff(base, draft)`** → reuse the diff infra for human review.
- **`merge(draft → main)`** → fast-forward the branch back, or refuse with an
  explicit conflict message if the target branch diverged. A future hosted slice
  can add three-way resolution on top of the same branch model.

The branch model now exists in the shared `GitRepoBackend` as
`forkBranch` / `mergeBranch`, so the same fast-forward semantics are available
to the browser `mem-fs` backend used by hosted git. The hosted playground now
binds those branch operations into a draft workspace lifecycle: the Durable
Object snapshot acts as the active working copy, while git branches define the
review boundary.

And the convergence property below makes `merge` and `re-pull` two routes to the
same state.

---

## The fork/merge ⇄ re-pull equivalence (formalize this)

The user's instinct — _"merge via git or rerun pull; they should be the same
thing"_ — is a real fixed-point property worth stating explicitly, because it
tells us when the demo is correct:

```text
Let  L  = local workspace (a git ref)
     R  = the live Onboarded account (remote truth)

pull:   L  := project(R)              // engine.pull writes R's snapshot into L
apply:  R  := reconcile(R, L)         // engine.apply pushes L's changes to R
plan:   diff(R, L)                    // what apply would do

A draft is a branch L' forked from L. The agent mutates L' -> L''.
```

There are then **two ways to land a draft**, and they converge:

1. **Git route:** `merge(L'' → L)`. Main now equals the draft. To make the
   _account_ match, you still run `apply` (plan/apply pushes L to R).
2. **Reconcile route:** `apply(L'')` directly (push the draft to R), then
   `pull` into L. Now `L == project(R) == project(reconcile(R, L''))`.

These reach the **same fixed point** exactly when the draft was the only writer
— i.e. `pull ∘ apply` is identity on a clean draft. The demo proves this: after
either route, a fresh `pull` produces **no plan changes** and the git tree of
`main` matches the re-pulled tree. That "empty plan after merge" is the
acceptance test for the whole loop.

Where they _diverge_ is the interesting product surface:

- If R changed underneath (someone else edited the account), `re-pull` surfaces
  it as a plan, and `merge` surfaces it as a git conflict — same information,
  two presentations. The local demo now shows the first presentation: a
  persisted mock remote drifts after fork but before merge, and `plan` surfaces
  the update before the fast-forward merge.

---

## Demo phases (smallest-first, each independently shippable)

Each phase is a checkpoint you can stop at and show.

### Phase 0 — `mina`, a named demo account

Replace/extend the anonymous "Demo Staffing" seed (`mock/seed.ts`) with a
richer, named **`mina`** account: a few custom properties, 2–3 forms, a policy
that references them, an automation. This is the fixture every later phase pulls
from, so it must exercise cross-references (forms → properties, policy → forms)
to make validation and diff meaningful.

- **Backend:** mock API (no cloud). **Show:** either make the default mock seed
  be `mina` or add an explicit account selector such as
  `seedOnboardedData({ account: "mina" })`. `seedOnboardedData('mina')` and
  `onboarded-deploy --account mina` do not exist today.

### Phase 1 — Connect + pull + commit (local, mock API)

Drive the existing engine end to end into a git repo on disk. The local
`--commit` option closes Seam A for this mode: pull writes files and then creates
the import commit in the same repo.

```bash
mkdir mina-config && cd mina-config && git init
# pull the mock account snapshot and create the import commit
onboarded-deploy pull --dir . --account mina --commit  # writes account.yaml, forms/*, config.lock.json, ...
onboarded-config web --dir .                        # history capability ON (git repo)
```

- **Prove git has the data:** `git log --oneline` shows the pull commit;
  `git show HEAD:account.yaml` returns the snapshot; `git cat-file -p` round-trips.
- **Acceptance:** `onboarded-deploy plan --dir .` is empty (local == remote).

> Local target behavior is implemented by `onboarded-deploy pull --commit`.
> Hosted browser/worker commit-on-change and deploy pull/apply are implemented
> in the local hosted e2e worker; production Cloudflare smoke coverage remains.

### Phase 2 — History RPC + panel (Seam B)

Surface what Phase 1 produced in the playground UI.

- `GetHistory`, a local server handler over the actual local git history
  adapter, the timeline panel, a schema-aware field diff for parsed YAML/JSON,
  and a raw per-revision file diff are implemented.
- **Show:** open `mina-config` in the IDE → History panel lists the pull commit
  → click it → diff shows the full add.

### Phase 3 — Agent edits + provenance commit

Let the agent change the config and prove attribution.

- Agent uses `write_artifact_source` (`packages/agent/src/artifact-toolkit.ts`)
  to, e.g., add a field to a form or tighten a policy rule.
- The change commits with `Actor: agent`, `Turn-Id`, `Tool-Call-Id` trailers.
  `ArtifactProjectChangeRequest` and `ArtifactChangeRequest` now carry optional
  provenance metadata, OpenRouter tool execution passes
  `{ actor: "agent", turnId, toolCallId }`; the local `LocalGitCommitter` path
  writes those trailers into commits, and hosted browser git commits preserve the
  same trailers when the hosted chat/tool path applies an agent change.
- The local walkthrough uses a deterministic scripted debug OpenRouter response
  so it exercises the real chat/tool/runtime path without requiring network or
  model credentials.
- **Prove:** `git log` shows the agent commit;
  `git blame forms/<form>.yaml` attributes the new field to the agent turn;
  the History panel shows actor = agent.
- **Validate:** `validate_artifact_project` runs clean (or the agent is shown
  fixing a diagnostic it introduced).

### Phase 4 — Fork → agent draft → review → merge (Seam C)

The full "copy of mina" story.

```text
fork mina  ->  branch draft/mina-q3
agent works the draft (several commits)
human opens diff(main, draft/mina-q3) in the History/diff panel
review -> merge draft/mina-q3 into main
```

- **Prove convergence:** after merge, `onboarded-deploy plan` against the
  account is empty _iff_ the draft was also applied; show both the git route and
  the re-pull route landing on the same tree (the acceptance test from the
  equivalence section).
- **Show drift:** mutate the account out-of-band before merge → `plan` (or merge)
  surfaces the conflict.

> Local status: `e2e-fork-merge.spec.ts` now proves fork → scripted agent draft
> commit → review diff → fast-forward merge back to `main`, with git assertions
> that `main` was unchanged until merge and equals the draft head after merge.
> It mutates a persisted Mina mock remote out-of-band and captures
> `03b-drift-detected` when pre-merge `plan` surfaces the update. It also

### Phase 5 — Hosted parity (Seam A, hosted case)

Make the identical loop run in the playground against a Cloudflare-provisioned
repo: browser-side isomorphic-git push through the worker CORS-proxy. Same UI,
same phases — only the provider + FS differ (exactly the local/Cloudflare split
already documented in [git-artifacts-demo.md](./git-artifacts-demo.md)).

> Hosted status: workspace creation now returns a proxied git remote and the
> worker forwards smart-HTTP Git traffic to Artifacts with server-side read/write
> tokens. The playground now clones/initializes that remote in `mem-fs`, commits
> the initial hosted snapshot, pushes user/agent workspace edits through the
> proxy, serves the History panel from that browser-side git clone, runs hosted
> chat/tool edits through the same provenance-aware committer, and runs the
> hosted Onboarded deploy service against the same git-backed browser store
> before mirroring committed deploy snapshots back to the hosted workspace. The
> hosted edit/history, deploy pull/apply, and agent provenance walkthroughs now
> run locally through `e2e-hosted.spec.ts` against that same git-backed browser
> store. The hosted fork/merge walkthrough uses the hosted Durable Object
> snapshot as the active working copy while browser git branches provide the
> review and merge boundary.

## E2E tests & screenshots are the deliverable

Every phase above lands with a **Playwright walkthrough spec** that drives the
real UI and captures **captioned screenshots**. The screenshots are not an
afterthought — they _are_ the acceptance artifact: a phase is "done" when its
spec passes and its screenshot baselines are committed. This also gives us a
visual changelog of the demo as it grows, and doc-ready imagery.

### Reuse the harness that already exists

The playground already has exactly the right rig (`apps/playground/`):

- **Runner:** `playwright.config.ts` — chromium, 1600×1000, snapshots under
  `tests/__screenshots__/{specPath}/`, `pnpm playground:e2e` (root) /
  `pnpm test:e2e` (app); refresh baselines with `pnpm playground:e2e:update`.
- **Captioned capture:** `tests/support/walkthrough.ts` — `createWalkthrough(testInfo)`
  returns `.capture(page, name, { caption })`, which asserts
  `toHaveScreenshot(name.png)` _and_ writes a `captions.json` (title + body per
  shot). This is the pattern to copy verbatim.
- **Servers under test:** the config already boots two — the memory-mode SPA
  (`:4318`) and the **local-filesystem** onboarded-config CLI
  (`onboarded-config … web --dir … :4319`). The local-git demo adds a third (see
  below). Existing precedent: `tests/app/onboarded-config-binary.spec.ts` already
  drives the `:4319` filesystem workspace and captures 12 preview screenshots.

> **Determinism:** the local-git fixture pins the import and scripted agent
> commit author/committer dates from `E2E_NOW` so Phase 1-3 screenshots are
> stable today. The broader cleanup is still to inject clock / id-source as
> **Effect services** so commit time, author, and ids are deterministic by
> construction across local, agent, and hosted paths.

### A third `webServer`: the git-backed workspace

The `:4320` `webServer` entry serves a **git-initialized** onboarded-config
workspace so the history/fork/merge phases have a real repo to render:

```text
command: run a setup script that creates a stable temp repo, runs onboarded-deploy pull --commit,
         writes the repo path to
         a known file/env location, then starts `onboarded-config web --dir <repo>`
url:     http://127.0.0.1:4320
```

The specs assert both **UI state** (History panel rows) _and_ **git ground
truth** by shelling out (`git -C <repo> log --format=…`) inside the test — the
two must agree. That dual assertion is what proves "git actually has the data,"
not just "the UI drew something." The repo path is written to
`tmp/onboarded-git-workspace.json` so specs can read it without depending on
Playwright's process environment.

`05-empty-plan-after-merge` is the visual form of the convergence acceptance test
from the equivalence section — a screenshot of an empty plan _is_ the proof that
merge and re-pull reached the same fixed point.

### Agent specs

Phase 3/4 specs drive the agent. Phase 3 uses the **debug OpenRouter client**
with `SCHEMATICS_E2E_SCRIPTED_AGENT=1`, which returns a deterministic
`write_artifact_source` call followed by `validate_artifact_project`. The `:4318`
server already runs with a mock API base
(`VITE_SCHEMATICS_API_BASE_URL=/__schematics_e2e__`), which is the pattern to
extend for future hosted or agent fixtures.

---

## How this serves the broader vision

Same payoffs as the original analysis, now with phase numbers attached:

- **Durable, inspectable history** (Phase 2) replaces the ephemeral in-memory
  `VersionedArtifactStore` revisions — reload-safe, undo/redo become ref moves.
- **Agent provenance** (Phase 3) — `git blame` a schema change to the exact
  agent turn via trailers.
- **Branch-per-proposal** (Phase 4) — an agent proposes config on a branch; a
  human reviews a diff and merges; `alchemy` plan/apply runs against a
  _committed_ revision, not live state.
- **Forking / templates / sharing** — "duplicate this workspace" is a git fork
  (Phase 4 generalizes to templates).
- **Blobs** ([plan-blob-artifacts.md](./plan-blob-artifacts.md)) — assets live
  content-addressed in the same repo (`GitBlobArtifactRef`).

## Open questions / risks

1. **Hosted parity is still scoped to the local mock worker.** Local
   `onboarded-deploy pull --commit` creates the import commit, and the hosted
   e2e worker now proves browser edit commits plus deploy pull/apply commits
   through the browser git store. Hosted fork/merge is also proven against the
   local hosted e2e worker. The remaining hosted risk is production Cloudflare
   smoke coverage against real Artifacts bindings and the deployed worker proxy.
   (Seam A, hosted.)
2. **Merge semantics in isomorphic-git.** Local fast-forward merge, pre-merge
   drift detection, explicit non-fast-forward conflict refusal, and shared
   browser-safe fast-forward branch plumbing are implemented; three-way conflict
   resolution is still future Seam C work.
3. **Hosted trailer threading.** Local agent/tool changes carry provenance into
   git commits, hosted deploy pull/apply writes `Actor: system` commits through
   the browser git store, and `e2e-hosted.spec.ts` now proves hosted agent
   commits include `Actor`, `Turn-Id`, and `Tool-Call-Id` trailers in the History
   panel. Production hosted smoke coverage is still covered by risk 1.
4. **Lockfile across branches.** `config.lock.json` maps slugs ↔ remote ids.
   Forks share it; confirm a draft branch doesn't desync the lockfile from the
   account it will eventually apply to.
5. **Convergence guarantee.** The "empty plan after merge" acceptance test only
   holds if `pull ∘ apply` is identity for the config kinds in play. Account is
   read-only; automations are import-only (`deploy.ts`) — verify those don't
   produce phantom plan diffs.

## First PR / current local slice

**Phases 1-4 against the local git path**, seeded by Phase 0's `mina` fixture.
It's the highest-signal slice: it makes the pull → commit → _see it in the UI_
loop real with zero cloud dependency, then proves agent attribution through git
trailers and blame. The Phase 4 local slice proves fast-forward branch-per-draft,
drift surfacing, non-fast-forward refusal, and the empty-plan fixed point against
a persisted mock remote. The hosted slice adds edit/history, deploy pull/apply,
and hosted agent provenance parity against the local hosted e2e worker. Shared
browser-safe fork/merge plumbing is now bound into the hosted playground for a
draft fork/edit/merge walkthrough; production Cloudflare smoke coverage remains
future work.

Scope of that PR concretely:

1. Phase 0 `mina` seed, including either a real account selector API or making
   `mina` the default mock account.
2. The local history substrate: `GetHistory` RPC plus a local handler backed by
   the current local git mechanism (or a refactor that makes the local service
   use a shared git history adapter).
3. The `:4320` git-backed `webServer` setup script with a deterministic repo
   path and an import commit created by `onboarded-deploy pull --commit`.
4. History panel and first diff view (Phase 2).
5. Local scripted agent provenance path (Phase 3), including trailers and blame
   attribution.
6. Local fast-forward fork/merge path (Phase 4), including branch-following
   commits, `onboarded-deploy fork` / `merge`, persisted-mock drift detection,
   non-fast-forward refusal, and empty-plan proof.
7. The `e2e-pull-commit.spec.ts`, `e2e-history-panel.spec.ts`,
   `e2e-agent-commit.spec.ts`, and `e2e-fork-merge.spec.ts` walkthroughs with
   committed screenshot baselines and `captions.json` — the visible acceptance
   artifact for the PR.
8. Hosted browser git parity for edit/history, Onboarded deploy pull/apply, and
   agent provenance, proven by `e2e-hosted.spec.ts` with
   `01-create-workspace`, `02-edit-committed`, `03-hosted-history`,
   `04-deploy-pull`, `05-deploy-apply`, `06-deploy-history`,
   `07-hosted-agent-prompt`, `08-hosted-agent-edit`, and
   `09-hosted-agent-history` screenshots.
9. Hosted fork/merge parity for the demo branch flow, proven by
   `e2e-hosted.spec.ts` with `10-hosted-fork-created`,
   `11-hosted-draft-edit`, and `12-hosted-draft-merged` screenshots.
